    - title: Graduate Resesarch Assistant 
      institution: Center for Autonomy, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
      year: 09.2024 - 05.2025
      description: 
        - Designed hardware components for an autonomous land yacht using AutoCAD, optimizing structure integrity for stable navigation across diverse terrains.
        - Developed navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance algorithms by fusing sensor and GPU data for real-time autonomy.
      
    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Intelligent Motion Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
      year: 02.2024 - 09.2024
      description:
        - Contributed to a robotic OCT eye examination system in collaboration with Duke University and the NIH. Collected and preprocessed datasets by annotating facial keypoints on public images and those captured in the project environment via a custom PyTorch workflow.
        - Led qualitative and quantitative stress tests to identify system limitations, thoroughly documented performance shortcomings, fine-tuned model hyperparameters, and enhanced system reliability across varied operating conditions.
        - Designed a custom four-point calibration within ROS using C++ to refine depth estimation from ZED camera data Benchmarked against the standard approach, achieving a 5% gain in depth accuracy under various conditions.

      institution: Autonomous Mechanical Systems Laboratory, Sookmyung Women's University
      year: 04.2020-03.2022
      description:
        - Preprocessed video data for the First Vision for Vitals Challenge by extracting regions of interest and using pyVHR for remote heart rate estimation, contributing to a model that achieved 4th place in the competition.
        - Refined a 70K image dataset for the AI-Hub Driver Distraction Detection project by removing duplicates and mislabeled samples, and extracting key visual features to ensure robust training inputs.
        - Trained and fine-tuned a DNN classifier, leveraging TensorFlow and scikit-learn for hyperparameter sweeps, improving detection accuracy by 15% over the baseline.
